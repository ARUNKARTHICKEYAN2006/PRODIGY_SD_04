Contact Management System
=========================

This is a simple Python program to manage contacts using the terminal. It allows the user to:

- Add a new contact (name, phone number, and email)
- View all saved contacts
- Modify an existing contact
- Delete a contact
- Exit the application

Features
--------

- Stores data in a dictionary (name as key, phone and email as values)
- Easy to use menu-driven interface
- Works completely in the terminal, no external libraries required

Note
----

This program does not save contacts permanently. All data will be lost once the program exits. For permanent storage, saving to a file can be added in the future.
